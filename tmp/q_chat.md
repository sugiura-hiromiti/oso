We've been troubleshooting an OS development project focusing on kernel execution in an AArch64 environment. Through memory dump analysis, we identified that while
your kernel code now correctly implements an infinite loop, execution still returns to the UEFI firmware's idle loop. This suggests that interrupts, exceptions, or
firmware control mechanisms are preempting your kernel's execution. I recommended modifying your kernel to disable interrupts before entering its main loop and
ensuring the bootloader properly exits UEFI boot services to give your kernel complete control of the system.

Based on the log file and your updated code, I can see that you've made significant progress. Your kernel now:

1. Disables interrupts with msr daifset, #2
2. Executes a wfi (Wait For Interrupt) instruction
3. Has an infinite loop that branches back to the wfi instruction

However, the program is still getting stuck in the UEFI firmware code. Let me analyze the possible causes:

## The Root Issue: UEFI Boot Services Not Exited

The most likely cause of your issue is that UEFI Boot Services are not being properly exited before transferring control to your kernel. This is a critical step in the

boot process.

When a UEFI application (your bootloader) loads a kernel, it needs to:

1. Load the kernel into memory
2. Get a memory map from UEFI
3. Exit Boot Services using the memory map
4. Transfer control to the kernel

If Boot Services are not exited:
‚Ä¢ UEFI firmware maintains control of the system
‚Ä¢ UEFI can preempt your kernel's execution
‚Ä¢ UEFI timer interrupts continue to fire
‚Ä¢ Your kernel doesn't have full control of the hardware

## Evidence from the Log

Looking at the log:

1. Your kernel code at 0x40010120 is correctly implementing:

   0x40010120: d50342df msr daifset, #2 // Disable interrupts
   0x40010124: 14000001 b #0x40010128
   0x40010128: d503207f wfi // Wait for interrupt
   0x4001012c: 17ffffff b #0x40010128 // Loop back

2. But the PC (Program Counter) is at 0x470f5174, which is in UEFI firmware code:

   0x470f5170: 940009b2 bl #0x470f7838
   0x470f5174: 17fffff8 b #0x470f5154 // <-- PC is here

3. This suggests that control has returned to the UEFI firmware after your kernel executed.

## How to Fix It

You need to modify your bootloader to properly exit UEFI Boot Services before transferring control to your kernel:

1. In your bootloader (oso_loader):

```rust
pub fn exec_kernel(kernel_entry: u64, _graphic_config: FrameBufConf) {
// Get the memory map
let mut memory_map_buffer = [0u8; 4096 * 4]; // Adjust size as needed
let memory_map = boot_services().get_memory_map(&mut memory_map_buffer)
.expect("Failed to get memory map");

    // Exit boot services
    boot_services().exit_boot_services(image_handle(), memory_map.key)
        .expect("Failed to exit boot services");

    // Now we're in runtime mode, no more UEFI Boot Services

    // Call the kernel
    let kernel_entry = kernel_entry as *const ();
    let entry_point = unsafe { core::mem::transmute::<_, extern "C" fn()>(kernel_entry) };
    entry_point();

    // This should never be reached if the kernel takes control

}
```

2. In your kernel:

```rust
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
pub extern "C" fn kernel_main() {
// Disable interrupts
unsafe {
asm!("msr daifset, #2");
}

    // Initialize your kernel
    // ...

    // Enter a controlled infinite loop
    loop {
        unsafe {
            asm!("wfi");
        }
    }

}
```

## Other Potential Issues

If exiting Boot Services doesn't solve the problem, consider these other potential causes:

1. Memory Map Issues: The memory map might be invalid or the kernel might be accessing memory it shouldn't.

2. Exception Handling: An exception might be occurring in your kernel that you're not handling.

3. Hardware Initialization: Some hardware might need to be initialized before your kernel can take full control.

4. Virtual Memory: If you're using virtual memory, the MMU setup might be incorrect.

5. UEFI Runtime Services: Even after exiting Boot Services, UEFI Runtime Services are still available and might be interfering.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Exit Boot Services: This is the most critical step.

2. Add Debug Output: If possible, add debug output in your bootloader before and after exiting Boot Services.

3. Check Memory Map: Ensure your kernel is loaded in a valid memory region.

4. Set Up Exception Handlers: Implement basic exception handlers in your kernel.

5. Try a Different Approach: If all else fails, try a simpler approach to booting your kernel.

The key insight is that your kernel code looks correct, but the UEFI firmware is still maintaining control of the system. Exiting Boot Services is the critical step to
transfer full control to your kernel.
