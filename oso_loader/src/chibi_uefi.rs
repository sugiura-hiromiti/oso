//! # Chibi UEFI - Lightweight UEFI Interface Wrapper
//!
//! This module provides a simplified, lightweight wrapper around UEFI (Unified Extensible
//! Firmware Interface) services and protocols. It abstracts the complexity of raw UEFI
//! operations while maintaining safety and efficiency for bootloader operations.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Safe Handle Management**: Type-safe wrappers around UEFI handles
//! - **Memory Management**: Simplified memory allocation and page management
//! - **Protocol Access**: Easy access to UEFI protocols and services
//! - **Console Operations**: Text input/output functionality
//! - **File System Access**: File and directory operations
//! - **Device Management**: Device discovery and controller operations
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - `console`: Text input/output operations
//! - `controller`: Device controller management
//! - `fs`: File system operations
//! - `guid`: UEFI GUID definitions and utilities
//! - `memory`: Memory allocation and management
//! - `protocol`: Protocol interface definitions
//! - `service`: Boot and runtime service wrappers
//! - `table`: System table access and management
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//!
//! This module follows a "chibi" (small/compact) design philosophy, providing
//! only the essential UEFI functionality needed for bootloader operations while
//! maintaining type safety and ease of use.
