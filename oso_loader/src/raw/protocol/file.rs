/**
---
Opens a new file relative to the source directory’s location.

# Description

The Open()function opens the file or directory referred to by FileName
relative to the location of This and returns a NewHandle.
The FileName may include the following path modifiers:

“\”

If the filename starts with a “\” the relative location is the root directory
that This resides on; otherwise “" separates name components.
Each name component is opened in turn,
and the handle to the last file opened is returned.

“.”

Opens the current location.

“..”

Opens the parent directory for the current location.
If the location is the root directory the request will return an error,
as there is no parent directory for the root directory.

If EFI_FILE_MODE_CREATE is set, then the file is created in the directory.
If the final location of FileName does not refer to a directory,
then the operation fails.
If the file does not exist in the directory, then a new file is created.
If the file already exists in the directory, then the existing file is opened.

If the medium of the device changes,
all accesses (including the File handle) will result in EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED.
To access the new medium, the volume must be reopened.

# Params

- NewHandle
A pointer to the location to return the opened handle for the new file.
See the type EFI_FILE_PROTOCOL description.

- FileName
The Null-terminated string of the name of the file to be opened.
The file name may contain the following path modifiers: “", “.”, and “..”.

- OpenMode
The mode to open the file.
The only valid combinations that the file may be opened with are:
Read, Read/Write, or Create/Read/Write.
See “Related Definitions” below.

- Attributes
Only valid for EFI_FILE_MODE_CREATE,
in which case these are the attribute bits for the newly created file.
See “Related Definitions” below.

The SetInfo() function sets information of type InformationType on the requested file.

an InformationType of EFI_FILE_INFO_ID can be used with a read-only file

In this circumstance, only the Attribute field of the EFI_FILE_INFO structure may be modified.
One or more calls to SetInfo() to change the Attribute field are permitted before it is closed.
The file attributes will be valid the next time the file is opened with Open().

An InformationType of EFI_FILE_SYSTEM_INFO_ID or EFI_FILE_SYSTEM_VOLUME_LABEL_ID
may not be used on read-only media.
