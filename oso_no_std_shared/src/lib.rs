//! # OSO No-Std Shared Library
//!
//! This crate provides shared utilities and data structures for the OSO operating system
//! that work in `no_std` environments. It serves as a foundational library containing
//! common functionality used across different components of the OSO ecosystem.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Bridge Module**: Low-level hardware interfaces and CPU control functions
//! - **Data Module**: Generic data structures like trees for system data management
//! - **Parser Module**: Parsing utilities for binary data, HTML, and code generation
//! - **CPU Control**: Platform-specific CPU power management functions
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! This crate is designed to work in bare-metal environments and uses several unstable
//! Rust features to provide zero-cost abstractions and compile-time optimizations.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use oso_no_std_shared::bridge::graphic::FrameBufConf;
//! use oso_no_std_shared::bridge::graphic::PixelFormatConf;
//! use oso_no_std_shared::wfi;
//!
//! // Configure graphics
//! let framebuf = FrameBufConf::new(
//! 	PixelFormatConf::Rgb,
//! 	0x1000_0000 as *mut u8,
//! 	1024 * 768 * 4,
//! 	1024,
//! 	768,
//! 	1024 * 4,
//! );
//!
//! // Enter low-power state
//! wfi(); // Never returns
//! ```
